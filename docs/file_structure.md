Below is the file structure for the .json and .mp3 files which are part of the gitignore for this project.

[Project Directory]
    |
    └ — downloads
    |   └ intros
    |   |   └ {file_name}.mp3
    |   |   └ etc.
    |   |
    |   └ pay_to_play
    |       └ {file_name}.mp3
    |       └ etc.
    |
    └ — json_files
        └ config.json
        └ item_prices.json
        └ jackpot.json
        └ users.json


I intend to make it so these will autogenerate on the first run, or to add dummy data, but that is for the future.

See json_file_structure.txt for insight into how the json files are structured
